                    <span className='font-medium text-[#91000D]'>Journal of International Business and Economics</span>  is an international journal that effectively provides a forum for academics and professionals to share the latest developments and advances in knowledge and practice of international business. The blind peer review and editorial policies are largely contributed by the 'international business forum' of American Association of International Researchers. The journal seeks to foster the exchange of ideas on a range of important international subjects and to provide stimulus for research and the further development of international perspectives. The international perspective is further enhanced by the cross-cultural spread of the contributors.
