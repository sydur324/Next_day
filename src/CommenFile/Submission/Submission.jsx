                                The editorial board is very strict regarding plagiarism.
                                The journal believes that taking the ideas and work of others
                                without giving them credit is unfair and dishonest.
                                Copying even one sentence from someone else's manuscript,
                                or even one of your own that has previously been published,
                                without proper citation is considered plagiarism-use your own words instead.
                                The editorial board retains the absolute authority to reject the review process of a
                                submitted manuscript if it subject to minor or major plagiarism and even may
